**Discora Dashboard** is the web-based command center for your Discora bot. It transforms server management from a series of text commands into an intuitive and powerful visual experience. Built with a modern stack featuring React and Appwrite, it gives you full control and ownership over your bot's configuration and your community's data.

Stop guessing commands and editing configuration files. Start managing your server with a tool designed for clarity and power.
